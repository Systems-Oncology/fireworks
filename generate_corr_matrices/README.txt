To generate locus-corrected coessentiality matrices as described in Amici et al 2020 http://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202000882

1. Create or designate a folder which has all three files in this submodule
2. Download Achilles/CERES data (https://depmap.org/portal/download/) and keep in the same folder (note: not stored here due to size)
3. Enter the filepath/name of the Achilles data file in the generate_corrected_coessential.py file
4. Execute generate_corrected_coessential.py to generate an h5 file (~2.5 gb) of all locus-adjusted correlations between genes in matrix format
